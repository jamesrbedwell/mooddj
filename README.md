##Choose Your Music Based on Your Face!
An app that links your Spotify account, your webcam, Microsofts Face API Emotion Regocnition, and plays songs based off your mood!

#The Idea
I struggle to decide on music, all the time and wanted to make this easier. 

When setting out on this project, I decided that controlling music based on your facial expression/mood would be an interesting concept. If there is more than one of you it should get the average mood, etc. I decided on using the Spotify API and to link your webcam with the Microsoft Azure Face API to get emotions back.

#Review
Functionality is there, however the search queries could be modified to return different results each time.

More features to skip songs through the web app as opposed to the device in which the music is playing off would also be great.

It would be nice to add extra features, users can keep track off all their photos etc.
